<link>http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2013/11/05/94fifty-smart-basketball-baig-review/3435703/</link>
<description>Tech columnist Ed Baig took to the court to test a new “smart basketball” equipped with nine sensors that communicate with an iPhone or iPad via Bluetooth wireless technology. The 94Fifty basketball and associated iOS app, made by InfoMotion Sports Technologies, tracks performance by measuring speed and pressure applied to the ball. It also coaches aspiring hoops stars with voice feedback. Users can work on drills or challenge other players. “My two small kids were engaged, and they were excited when they improved their scores,” Baig reports.</description>

<link>http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57610534-71/kids-no-1-holiday-wish-the-iphone-says-a-survey/</link>
<description>In a CNET article, author Chris Matyszczyk discusses a survey that puts iPhone at the top of young people’s holiday gift list. The survey, conducted for shopping website Ebates, asked 12- to 17-year-olds which gadget they most crave, and iPhone came in first. “These kids know their brands, and only 12 percent of them were most desperate for a Samsung Galaxy phone, as opposed to 32 percent for Apple’s offering,” Matyszczyk writes. “Indeed, the second most desired gadget was another Apple product: the iPad.”</description>

<link>http://www.apple.com/ipad-air/?sr=hotnews.rss</link>
<description>The first iPad Air reviews are in from The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, The New York Times, and others. And the reaction is overwhelmingly positive.

Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal says iPad Air is “raising the bar,” calling the redesign a “feat of design and engineering.” He notes the battery test “far exceeded Apple’s claim” and “blew me away.”

Ed Baig of USA Today declares iPad Air the best yet and “better than its already best of breed predecessors, superior still to each and every rival big screen slate that I’ve tested. Apple dominates the tablet apps ecosystem. Its tablet remains the easiest to use.”

Damon Darlin at The New York Times writes, “Compared with the other tablets on the market, Apple still holds the edge.” He highlights many of iPad Air’s key features including size, battery life, processing power, storage, and Wi-Fi with MIMO. 

On his blog, David Pogue is impressed with the battery life, speed, and design of iPad Air, stating, “Somehow, Apple was able to put the iPad on such a radical diet without sacrificing any of its features.”

<link>http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-apple-ipad-business-20131022,0,4929094.story</link>
<description>In a recent Los Angeles Times story, technology reporter Chris O’Brien highlights examples of how businesses are using iPad and describes how the device is becoming a force in the workplace. He notes that iPad “helped Apple stake out a commanding lead for mobile devices in business markets long dominated by PCs and laptops running Microsoft’s Windows.” O’Brien talks to industry analysts including IDC’s Tom Mainelli, who says, “Apple has become the de-facto standard in a lot of commercial enterprises in terms of tablets.” Companies are creating their own apps, too. According to one report, O’Brien writes, “90 percent of custom tablet apps created by businesses for internal use or for their customers were written for the iPad.” </description>

<link>http://www.apple.com/iphone/?sr=hotnews.rss</link>
<description>The first iPhone and iOS 7 reviews are in from news organizations including The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and The New York Times:

Walter S. Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal recommends iPhone 5s “for anyone looking for a premium, advanced smartphone.” He calls the phone’s Touch ID fingerprint sensor “a potentially game-changing hardware feature” and iOS 7 “a radically new operating system.”

Ed Baig of USA Today looks at both iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c. On the iPhone 5s, he writes, “Taken in totality, the features new to the iPhone 5s make what I consider to be the best smartphone on the market even better.” He concludes, “I can strongly recommend either new iPhone but especially the 5s.”

David Pogue of The New York Times posts two stories. In his iOS review he writes, “The structure, layout and features represent some of Apple’s best work.” In his iPhone review, he calls iPhone 5c “a terrific phone,” noting, “The price is right. It will sell like hot cakes.” On iPhone 5s, he’s impressed with the improved camera and says the best part of Touch ID is “it actually works — every single time, in my tests.
