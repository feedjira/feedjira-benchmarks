 <title>“Popcorn, you have a full reprieve from cranberry sauce and stuffing. We wish you well.”</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/27/presidential-turkey-pardon-curious-if-humane-tradition</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>We&#39;ve come a long way since 11-year-old Tad Lincoln convinced his father to &quot;adopt&quot; a turkey named Jack in 1863.</p>
<div>
	Today, President Obama pardoned two 20-week-old, 38-pound turkeys named Popcorn and Caramel -- and announced Popcorn as the official &quot;National Thanksgiving Turkey,&quot; after the American public weighed in on their favorites via Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The President noted:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><div>
		The competition was stiff, but we can officially declare that Popcorn is the winner -- proving that even a turkey with a funny name can find a place in politics. As for Caramel, he&rsquo;s sticking around, and he&rsquo;s already busy raising money for his next campaign.</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
	And so, all &quot;Hunger Games&quot; references aside, both turkeys will live. Popcorn and Caramel will spend the rest of their natural days in the historic rolling pastures of Morven Park&#39;s Turkey Hill -- located at the home of former Virginia governor Westmoreland Davis in Leesburg, Virginia.</div>

 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/27/report-road-community-colleges-leveraging-partnerships-economic-growth</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Ed. note: This is cross-posted from the Department of Labor blog. See the original post&nbsp;<a href="http://social.dol.gov/blog/report-from-the-road/">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have had the chance to step onto a community college campus recently, you know the special role they are playing in rebuilding the American economy. Over the last three years, this administration has made unprecedented investments in the community college system through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training &minus; or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.doleta.gov/taaccct/" target="_blank" title="Information about the TAACCCT program">TAACCCT</a>&nbsp;&minus; grant program. These grants encourage schools across the country to work with each other, with the workforce system and with employers to create cutting edge training programs that prepare workers for the jobs of today and tomorrow.</p>

    At Cleveland Community College in Shelby, N.C., Dr. Jill Biden and Secretary Perez listen in as Kenneth Dover (second from right) talks about his experience making the transition from the Marines to a career in "mission critical" IT operations.

 <title>Calling All Young Americans: We Want to Hear from You!</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/27/calling-all-young-americans-we-want-hear-you</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Throughout President Obama&#39;s career, he has been fighting for young people. Whether it is<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/higher-education"> increasing access to higher education</a>, or expanding <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/healthreform">health care coverage</a>, giving young people a fair shot has been and always will be a priority.</p>
<p>The President also believes in <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/engage">reaching out to youth across the country</a> to make sure we&rsquo;re hearing what they have to say, and helping them better understand the policies and programs that impact them. That&rsquo;s why, on Wednesday, December 4th, we&rsquo;re hosting over 150 leaders from across the country at the White House for a Youth Summit. The Summit will offer young people coming to the White House and across the country a chance to discuss the Affordable Care Act and others issues important to them.</p>

During this live video chat, we&#39;ll announce the winners of the &quot;<a href="http://health.younginvincibles.org/video-contest/">Healthy Young America Video Contest</a>,&quot; preview the upcoming Youth Summit, and take questions about the Affordable Care Act and what It means for young Americans. &nbsp;</p>

 <title>Going Big for Small Business Saturday</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/27/going-big-small-business-saturday</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This Saturday, November 30th, I will join a number of White House and Cabinet Officials, along with millions of Americans around the country, in paying tribute to small businesses, which drive our economy, and help to define the spirit of our communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">I will be spending <b>Small Business Saturday</b> in Chicago, to start on my holiday shopping, and reacquaint myself with the small businesses lining my hometown streets, and breathing life into my neighborhood.</p>
<p class="p1">There is of course, no need to wait for Small Business Saturday to enjoy the local delicacies and the unique goods being sold in our communities.&nbsp; It can be a concerted effort throughout the year, and an ongoing priority for all Americans.&nbsp; The President certainly sees it that way, and has made <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/small_business_saturday_-_emessage.pdf">support for small business</a> a top priority every day he has spent in office.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Yesterday, President Obama visited the DreamWorks Animation Campus in Glendale, California, where he spoke about the economy before an audience of nearly 2,000 Dreamworks employees, including CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The President began by calling entertainment &quot;one of America&#39;s biggest exports&quot; -- and, in some ways, a part of American diplomacy:</div>
<blockquote><div>
		&nbsp;</div>
<div>
		It&rsquo;s part of what makes us exceptional, part of what makes us such a world power. You can go anywhere on the planet and you&rsquo;ll see a kid wearing a &ldquo;Madagascar&rdquo; T-shirt. You can say, &ldquo;May the Force be with you&rdquo; -- they know what you&rsquo;re talking about. Hundreds of millions of people may never set foot in the United States, but thanks to you, they&rsquo;ve experienced a small part of what makes our country special. They&rsquo;ve learned something about our values. We have shaped a world culture through you.</div>
</blockquote>

	He then reflected on the significant economic progress that we&#39;ve made over the past several years: including reining in spending after years of trillion-dollar deficits, changing the tax code to be fairer toward middle-class Americans, winding down two wars, and creating 7.8 million new jobs over the past 44 months -- all the while cutting our deficits by more than half.</div>

 <title>A Woman&#039;s Health Care Decisions Should Be in Her Own Hands, Not Her Boss&#039;s </title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/26/womans-health-care-decisions-should-be-her-own-hands-not-her-bosss</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Ed. note: This is cross-posted from The Huffington Post. See the original post <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/valerie-jarrett/supreme-court-birth-control_b_4346143.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Ensuring the full freedom of women as health care consumers to access essential preventative health services is a vital component of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). And nowhere are health decisions more personal or essential to keep in their hands, than those regarding reproductive health. The ACA was designed to ensure that health care decisions are made between a woman and her doctor, and not by her boss, or Washington politicians.</p>
<p>Today, there are people trying to take this right away from women, by letting private, for-profit corporations and employers make medical decisions for their employees, based on their personal beliefs.</p>
<p>A group of for-profit companies are currently suing to gain the right to deny employees access to coverage for birth control and contraceptive care, which are used by the overwhelming majority of American women in their lifetimes. Among the first cases to reach the Supreme Court is one filed by Hobby Lobby, an arts and crafts chain whose owners want to be able to take the option for birth control benefits away from their employees.</p>

 <title>Seniors Save Nearly $9 Billion on Prescription Drugs Thanks to the Affordable Care Act </title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/26/seniors-save-nearly-9-billion-prescription-drugs-thanks-affordable-care-act</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today, the Administration <a href="http://cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Press-Releases/2013-Press-Releases-Items/2013-11-26.html">released new data showing</a> that Affordable Care Act is helping more seniors save more money on their prescription drug costs.</p>
<p class="p1">Since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, more than 7.3 million seniors and people with disabilities have saved $8.9 billion on their prescription drugs, an average of $1,209 per person since 2010.</p>
<p class="p1">Before the Affordable Care Act, many people with Medicare Part D would pay out-of-pocket for the entire cost of prescription drugs once they hit the coverage gap in prescription drug benefits known as the &ldquo;donut hole.&rdquo; Beneficiaries continued paying full price for prescriptions until reaching catastrophic coverage.</p>
<p class="p1">But under a discount program in the Affordable Care Act, anyone with a Medicare prescription drug plan who reached the prescription drug donut hole in 2010 got a $250 rebate. Beginning in 2011, beneficiaries who landed in the donut hole began receiving discounts on covered brand-name drugs and savings on generic drugs.</p>

 <title>Celebrate #GivingTuesday  </title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/26/celebrate-givingtuesday</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Typically, the holidays are a moment when many Americans volunteer to help the most vulnerable. Others make charitable contributions that can last throughout the holiday season. Next week, we will celebrate <a href="http://givingtuesday.org/">#GivingTuesday</a>, a worldwide effort to raise awareness and motivate action for the common good.</p>
<p class="p1">Started by the <a href="http://www.unfoundation.org/">United Nations Foundation</a> and the <a href="http://www.92y.org/">92d Street Y</a>, #GivingTuesday builds on the American tradition of giving back but uses technology to give this greater impact. This commemoration does not seek to coordinate funds toward any particular nonprofit or to direct volunteers to support a specific cause. Instead, #GivingTuesday is intended to encourage Americans to reflect and give back. It&rsquo;s a collective moment for individual and community action.</p>
<p class="p1">#GivingTuesday has significant momentum. More than 7000 partners across all 50 states are taking part. This includes large corporations and small businesses, faith-based organizations and secular nonprofits. This year,&nbsp;cities are stepping forward to galvanize the movement.&nbsp; They are celebrating local causes through unique campaigns like&nbsp;<a href="http://bmoregivesmore.com/">BMoreGivesMore</a>&nbsp;in Baltimore;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.givingtuesdaybucks.org/">#GivingTuesdayBucks</a>&nbsp;in Bucks County, PA; and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.generocity.org/givingtuesdayphl-tell-us-what-your-organization-is-doing/">#GivingTuesdayPHL</a> in Philadelphia. In all these communities, nonprofits, businesses and government are collaborating to raise awareness and drive funds for those in need.</p>

 <title>We the Geeks: Talking Turkey and the Science of Cooking</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/26/we-geeks-talking-turkey-and-science-cooking</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Ed. note: This event has concluded. Watch the full hangout below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As we prepare for <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/turkey">Thanksgiving here at the White House</a>, you&rsquo;re invited to join me and a lineup of top food experts as we &ldquo;talk turkey&rdquo; and dive into our dinner plates to explore the science of cooking. We&rsquo;ll be drilling down into the science behind what makes turkey so tasty, why we feel compelled to nap after eating it, and the secret science sauce behind brining and marinating.</p>
<p>Please join us this Wednesday at 12pm ET for a We the Geeks on the Science of Cooking! The episode will air on <a href="http://www.WhiteHouse.gov/wethegeeks">www.WhiteHouse.gov/wethegeeks</a> in the run-up to President Obama&rsquo;s annual turkey pardoning at the White House.</p>
<p>Join&nbsp;Food Network Chef Anne Burrell, former NASA astronaut Ron Garan, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy&#39;s Kumar Garg, and me as we discuss the raw science behind turkey, stuffing, and other fixins&rsquo; on our Thanksgiving tables like breads, whole grains, flour, and gluten. We&rsquo;ll also shed light on the exciting chemistry behind cooking and eating: How much carbon dioxide do we consume when eat a meal? And what exactly is fermentation anyway?</p>
<p>We&#39;ll also explore how cooking can be used to get more kids excited about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education.</p>
<p>Got comments or questions? Ask them using the hashtag&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wethegeeks&amp;src=hash">#WeTheGeeks</a>&nbsp;on Twitter and on&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/+whitehouse/posts">Google+</a>&nbsp;and we&#39;ll answer some of them during the live Hangout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/wethegeeks">We the Geeks</a>&quot; is a series of Google+ Hangouts to discuss science, technology, and innovation here in the United States. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wethegeeks&amp;src=hash">Join the conversation</a> on Twitter and be sure to sign up for email updates about future &quot;We the Geeks&quot; hangouts.</p>

<p>The first ever White House Student Film Festival launches today &mdash; and it&#39;s open to U.S. students, grades K-12. We&#39;re asking you to answer these big questions:</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your education story &amp; how does technology and connectivity fit into how you learn at school or on your own? How do you imagine technology will change the educational experience for kids in the future?</p>
<p>Films can be short &ndash; in fact 3 minutes tops. The official selections will be featured on the White House website, and shared across the world on White House sites and official social media accounts. In fact, if selected, you may have a chance to attend the film fest yourself at the White House.</p>
<p>Ready to get started? Check out our official page at WhiteHouse.Gov/FilmFest -- where you can learn more, read the official rules, see how to submit your video, and hear from Bill Nye (the Science Guy). And if you&#39;re a parent, guardian, or teacher, make sure you spread the word to kids with big ideas!</p>
<p>We can&#39;t wait to see what you make.</p>
<p>Here are more important details you should know:</p>
<p>--Every student entry has to have a parent/guardian or teacher sponsor.</p>
<p>--Films can be submitted now through January 29th, 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>--If your video is selected as an official selection, you could have a chance to attend the mid-February screening at the White House.</p>

 <title>The Gobble: Help Choose the 2013 National Thanksgiving Turkey</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/25/gobble-help-choose-2013-national-thanksgiving-turkey-0</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="/turkey"><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/turkeys/blog_banner_2013_turkey2.jpg" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">On Wednesday, November 27th, President Obama will pardon the 2013 National Thanksgiving Turkey and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/11/20/thanksgiving-decision-2012-cobbler-or-gobbler">once again the American people will decide</a>&nbsp;which bird takes the title.</p>
<p class="p2">Turkeys have carved out a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/23/definitive-history-presidential-turkey-pardon">pivotal role in the holiday season at the White House</a>&nbsp;since the 19th century, but last year, for the first time, the pardon winner was chosen through a competitive online vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">Which of these two turkeys will be plucked from obscurity and awarded the title?&nbsp;Hatched on the same day on the farm of John Burkel near Badger, Minnesota, Caramel and Popcorn may have been raised together, but each has flown their own path. Caramel is a steady and deliberate bird that enjoys soybean meal and rocking out to Lady Gaga. When Popcorn is feeling peckish, he can&#39;t stop snacking on his namesake, corn, and has been known to strut around to Beyonce&#39;s &quot;Halo&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">People all across the country are flocking to cast a vote, so be sure to learn more about Caramel and Popcorn, listen to them croon their distinct gobble sounds and then tell us who you think should be named the National Thanksgiving Turkey!&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2"><b>Are you on #TeamCaramel or #TeamPopcorn?&nbsp;Find out how you can vote on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/turkey">Whitehouse.gov/Turkey</a>.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p class="p2">We&#39;ll count up the hashtags to make sure there&#39;s no fowl play.&nbsp;The deadline for voting is 8pm ET on Tuesday, November 26th.</p>
<p class="p3">Don&#39;t forget to tune in to President Obama&#39;s remarks and the ceremony on Wednesday, November 27th on&nbsp;<a href="http://wh.gov/live">http://wh.gov/live</a>&nbsp;at 1:15 pm ET to find out which turkey has been selected as the 2013 National Thanksgiving Turkey.&nbsp;And for more on how this Presidential tradition came to be check out the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/23/definitive-history-presidential-turkey-pardon">definitive history of the Presidential Turkey Pardon</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">Note: It&#39;s all gravy -- no turkeys will be harmed during the selection of the National Thanksgiving Turkey.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the pardoning, both turkeys travel to George Washington&rsquo;s Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens where they will be on display for visitors during &quot;Christmas at Mount Vernon.&quot; The turkeys will then travel to their permanent home at Morven Park&#39;s Turkey Hill, the historic turkey farm located at the home of former Virginia Governor Westmorland Davis in Leesburg, Virginia. Additionally, if for any reason one turkey is unable to perform the duties of the National Thanksgiving Turkey, his alternate will take his place during the National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation.</p>

<p>In the early 1900s, more than 300,000 people passed through California&rsquo;s Angel Island on their way to a new life in America, many drawn by the belief that here, anything was possible.</p>
<p>Today, just a few miles away at the Betty Ong Recreation Center in San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/11/25/remarks-president-immigration-reform-san-francisco-ca">President Obama said he is committed</a> to fixing our broken immigration system to make sure we continue welcoming striving, hardworking immigrants who see America the same way many of our ancestors did when they came here generations ago -- as a country where no matter who you are or what you look like or where you come from, you can make it if you try.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too often when we talk about immigration, the debate focuses on our southern border,&rdquo; President Obama said. But immigrants from all over the world have put down roots in every corner of the country. In San Francisco, where the economy is one of the fastest growing in the country, 35 percent of business owners are immigrants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the impact that our talented, hardworking immigrants can have,&quot;&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the difference they can make.&nbsp;And that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s long past time to reform an immigration system that doesn&rsquo;t serve America as well as it should &ndash; because we should be doing more to unleash that potential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>President Obama shared the story of Andrew Ly and his brothers, who emigrated from Vietnam by way of Malaysia. Once they arrived in San Francisco, they learned English and worked as handymen and seamstresses.</p>
<blockquote><p>Eventually, Andrew and his brothers earned enough money to buy a small bakery.&nbsp;And they started making donuts, and they started selling them to Chinese restaurants.&nbsp;And with a lot of hard work and a little luck, the Sugar Bowl Bakery today is a $60 million business. So these humble and striving immigrants from Vietnam now employ more than 300 Americans.&nbsp;They&rsquo;re supplying pastries to Costco and Safeway, and almost every hotel and hospital in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>

 <title>On November 30th, Start the Holiday Season by Shopping Small</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/25/november-30th-start-holiday-season-shopping-small</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Ed. note: This is cross-posted from the U.S. Small Business Administration. See the original post&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sba.gov/community/blogs/official-sba-news-and-views/open-business/november-30th-start-holiday-season-shopping-small">here</a>.</p>
<p>Most Americans know Black Friday and Cyber Monday are big days for holiday shopping. But between the two is another important part of the holiday shopping season &ndash;<a href="http://www.sba.gov/saturday" target="_blank">Small Business Saturday</a>, a day that is dedicated to supporting the small businesses that anchor our local communities and strengthen our economy.</p>
<p>From the Main Street shops to the high-tech startups, small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the cornerstones of a diverse and thriving marketplace. These businesses create two out of every three net new private sector jobs, and half of working Americans either own or work for a small business. By shopping small and supporting local business, we all have a role to play in giving millions of families the opportunity to achieve the American dream.</p>
<p>Small Business Saturday is a nation-wide initiative that bring Americans together &nbsp;to support these businesses, with the money you spend going right back into your local economy, and that&rsquo;s important because we know that half of working Americans either own or work for a small business.</p>
<p>Started in 2010, Small Business Saturday has boosted holiday sales in Main Street businesses around the country. Last year, nearly 70 million people shopped small in their communities for an estimated $5.5 billion in sales to independently-owned small businesses. This year, we can do even more!</p>

 <title>Visiting the Fast for Families in Support of Immigration Reform</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/21/visiting-fast-families-support-immigration-reform</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the many years that I have worked in the Latino community and the civil rights movement, I have seen the photo many times, perhaps more than any other photo. Often it is dog-eared from having been on a wall for many years, or pulled out of a wallet many times. It&rsquo;s a photo of Cesar Chavez, weak from fasting over many weeks. Next to him is Robert Kennedy, who visited him and offered his support and solidarity during the fast. Chavez is leaning heavily on Kennedy, who has his hand on Chavez&rsquo; arm; one is smiling weakly, the other brightly.&nbsp;&nbsp; The photo is dear to people who remember the years of Chavez organizing farmworkers, bringing his tremendous moral authority to their struggle.</p>
<p>The photo has been on my mind a great deal this week, as another fighter for justice, my friend Eliseo Medina, begins the second week of the Fast for Families, which is taking place in a tent near the U.S. Capitol. He, along with Rev. Sam Rodriguez, Dae Joong Yoon, Lisa Sharon Harper, Cristian Avila, and Marco Grimaldo are fasting to draw attention to the urgent need for immigration reform.</p>
<p>I had the honor of visiting with the fasters and hearing their stories on day 9 of their water-only fast, and I was deeply moved by their moral commitment. They described why immigration reform matters in their lives, as it does for Christian, a DREAMer who told me he is fasting for his own chance at citizenship, to honor his parents, and to call attention to the need for immigration reform to keep his family from the threat of separation.&nbsp;They shared with me their hopes for achieving an immigration reform that feels within reach, because the House of Representatives has the support it needs to pass legislation, and the coalition supporting it has unprecedented depth and strength. They described empty stomachs but full hearts as they receive an outpouring of support; to date, more than 3000 people around the country have committed to fasting in solidarity.</p>

 <title>Here&#039;s Why Today&#039;s Filibuster Rule Change is a Big Deal</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/21/heres-why-todays-filibuster-rule-change-really-big-deal</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p class="rteright"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joZFPU6nhQU">Watch on YouTube.</a></p>
<p>Something big happened in the Senate today: A majority of senators voted to change the way the filibuster works. (<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/legislative-branch#Filibuster">You can read more about what a filibuster does here.</a>)</p>
<p>Under today&#39;s rule change, all executive branch and&nbsp;judicial nominees -- except to the Supreme Court -- can be confirmed with a simple up-or-down vote rather than the previously required 60-vote supermajority.</p>
<p>Speaking from the White House Press Briefing Room today, the President supported the change and provided context for why it&#39;s especially pertinent right now:</p>
<blockquote><p>All too often, we&#39;ve seen a single senator or a handful of senators choose to abuse arcane procedural tactics to unilaterally block bipartisan compromises, or to prevent well-qualified, patriotic Americans from filling critical positions of public service in our system of government.</p>
<p>Now, at a time when millions of American have desperately searched for work, repeated abuse of these tactics have blocked legislation that might create jobs. They&#39;ve defeated actions that would help women fighting for equal pay. They&#39;ve prevented more progress than we would have liked for striving young immigrants trying to earn their citizenship. Or it&#39;s blocked efforts to end tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. They&#39;ve even been used to block common-sense and widely supported steps to protect more Americans from gun violence, even as families of victims sat in the Senate chamber and watched. &nbsp;And they&#39;ve prevented far too many talented Americans from serving their country at a time when their country needs their talents the most.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the President went on to note, in the six decades before he took office, only 20 presidential nominees to executive positions had to overcome filibusters. &quot;But in just under five years since I took office, nearly 30 nominees have been treated this way,&quot; the President said.</p>

 <title>Improving Consumer Information - New Letters Make Health Insurance Choices Clear</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/21/improving-consumer-informations-new-letters-make-health-insurance-choices-clear</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) <a href="http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-Guidance/Downloads/standard-notice-bulletin-11-21-2013.pdf">took a major step</a> to give consumers across the country new, standardized information about their options and rights when it comes to health insurance. This effort is a direct response to the President&rsquo;s concerns that the small percentage of Americans receiving confusing letters from their insurance companies need clearer information about how to keep an existing plan, or how to choose a new plan with new protections available in the health insurance marketplace.</p>
<p class="p1">Because of the Affordable Care Act, people with health insurance have stronger protections than ever before.&nbsp; This means that consumers in new health insurance plans will no longer be charged more because of gender or a pre-existing condition, there will be caps on out-of-pocket costs, and plans will have to offer a basic package of <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/what-does-marketplace-health-insurance-cover/">10 categories of essential health benefits</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">These new market rules do not apply if you are in the same health plan you were in when the law passed, a so-called grandfathered plan.&nbsp; Your plan does not need to meet these new requirements &ndash; and your plan is required to let you know that.&nbsp; Additionally, these protections may not apply if your insurer takes the new option announced by the President last week.&nbsp; This transitional policy allows issuers in states that permit it to renew health plans that were in effect on October 1, 2013, without adopting all of the 2014 market rule changes.&nbsp; This helps give consumers in the individual and small group markets the choice of staying in their plan or joining a new Marketplace plan next year.&nbsp;</p>

 <title>We the Geeks: Student Startups</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/20/we-geeks-student-startups</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>Ed. note: This event has concluded. Watch the full hangout below.<br />
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us come together and help aspiring entrepreneurs take a chance on themselves and their visions for a brighter future.&rdquo;&nbsp;&mdash;President Obama on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/10/31/presidential-proclamation-national-entrepreneurship-month-2013">National Entrepreneurship Month</a>, November 2013</p>
<p>For generations, Americans have turned innovative ideas into small businesses, large companies, and entire industries that have revolutionized the economy, created millions of jobs, and transformed life as we know it&mdash;here at home and around the globe. That entrepreneurial spirit is the foundation of America&rsquo;s story and is critical to ensuring future successes for generations to come. We know from experience that potentially game-changing innovative ideas are born in all corners of the Nation&mdash;in every state and region, at laboratory benches and on factory floors, in boardrooms and city halls, at community meetings, in classrooms, and on college campuses.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, on November 22, which the President has designated&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/10/31/presidential-proclamation-national-entrepreneurship-month-2013">National Entrepreneurs&rsquo; Day</a>, we&rsquo;re&nbsp;celebrating the extraordinary stories of&nbsp;young entrepreneurs&mdash;students who, along with all the usual demands of pursuing a high school, college, or a graduate degree, are building companies today that are spreading homegrown ideas all over the world. Two proven entrepreneurs featured on the popular TV show&nbsp;Shark Tank&nbsp;will join these student innovators to share lessons from their own entrepreneurial journeys.</p>
<p>Join us this&nbsp;Friday November 22, at 2:00 pm EST for a &ldquo;We the Geeks&rdquo; Google+ Hangout, called &ldquo;Student Startups&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; where leading student entrepreneurs and business moguls will talk about how anyone can&nbsp;<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/05/startup-culture-flourishes-america-s-college-campuses">cultivate a culture of entrepreneurship</a>&nbsp;in his or her own community.&nbsp;</p>

 <title>New Report from the Council of Economic Advisers: The Recent Slowdown in Health Care Cost Growth and the Role of the Affordable Care Act</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/20/new-report-from-council-economic-advisers-recent</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed against a backdrop of decades of rapid growth in health care spending, and one of the ACA&rsquo;s key goals was to root out serious inefficiencies in the United States health care system that increase costs and compromise patients&rsquo; quality of care. Recent data show that health care spending and prices are growing at their slowest rates in decades; it appears that something has changed for the better. While this marked slowdown likely has many causes, and these causes are not yet fully understood, the available evidence suggests that the ACA is contributing to these trends, and, moreover, is helping to improve quality of care for patients. Today the White House Council of Economic Advisers released a new report analyzing recent trends in health costs, the forces driving those trends, and their likely economic benefits. Read the full report <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/healthcostreport_final_noembargo_v2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Key points in <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/healthcostreport_final_noembargo_v2.pdf">today&#39;s report</a> from the Council of Economic Advisers:</p>
<p>1. Health care spending is growing at the slowest rate on record: According to the most recent <a href="http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Downloads/Proj2012.pdf">projections</a>, real per capita health care spending has grown at an estimated average annual rate of just 1.3 percent over the three years since 2010. This is the lowest rate on record for any three-year period and less than one-third the long-term historical average stretching back to 1965. This slower growth in spending is reflected in Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/sites/default/files/image/enrollee_growth_whitehouse.jpg" /></p>
<p>2. Health care price inflation is at its lowest rate in 50 years: Measured using personal consumption expenditure price indices, inflation for health care goods and services is currently running at just 1 percent on a year-over-year basis, the lowest level since January 1962.&nbsp; (Health care inflation measured using the medical CPI is lower than at any time since September 1972.)</p>

 <title>Building a Smarter, More Efficient Government through “Pay for Success”</title>
 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/20/building-smarter-more-efficient-government-through-pay-success</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>In recent weeks, the Administration has taken several steps to advance Pay for Success, an innovative approach for the government to partner with philanthropic and private investors to fund proven and promising practices, significantly enhancing the return on taxpayer investments. Under this model, these organizations provide the up-front capital for social services with a strong evidence base that, when successful, achieve measurable outcomes that improve the lives of families and individuals and reduce their need for future services.&nbsp;Government pays when these measurable results are achieved.</p>
<p>This week, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) <a href="http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=5696-n-06_cdbg-frnotice.pdf">announced </a>&nbsp;it will provide $5 billion in grant dollars to assist in the rebuilding and strengthening effort following Hurricane Sandy and encouraged the five states impacted by the storm to make use of evidence-based, Pay for Success strategies where appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This funding will create new opportunities to rebuild damaged infrastructure, stronger than it was before the storm. Possible projects include management of increased storm water, reducing future flood damage, and protecting water treatment facilities.</p>

 <link>http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/11/19/president-obamas-handwritten-essay-marking-150th-anniversary-gettysburg-address</link>
 <description><![CDATA[<p>One hundred and fifty years ago today, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/abrahamlincoln">President Abraham Lincoln</a> delivered one of the most memorable speeches in U.S. history from Gettysburg, PA. In dedicating the military cemetery where thousands of soldiers were buried following the Battle of Gettysburg, fought just four months earlier, Lincoln described &quot;a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.&quot;</p>
<p>Paying tribute to the historic speech, President Obama hand wrote an essay for an exhibit at the <a href="http://www.alplm.org/">Lincoln Presidential Library</a>. President Obama joins former Presidents Clinton, Carter and H.W. Bush who have submitted their contributions, along with other notable essayists including Justice Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor, General Colin Powell, and Martin Luther King III, among hundreds of others.</p>

<div>

<div>
	Right now, our lawmakers are in a position to take action on multiple national measures that would help our economy and millions of Americans. That&#39;s not an exaggeration: They could vote tomorrow. And they should.</div>
